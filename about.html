<h2 id="h2">My New Journey Began When <br> I Signed Up for a Frontend Coding Bootcamp!</h2>

<p><div id="box-color"><p><font size="+2"> You're probably wondering how I traded in my dull steal toed boots for a swanky<br>
coding keyboard and made the leap to a more fulfilling career...Well, it all started <br>
with a spark of inspiration and a dash of self-improvement. I enrolled in a <br>
Frontend coding bootcamp back in November, and let me tell you, some weeks have been<br>
a rollercoaster ride of excitement and frustration, but I'm still here and coding away!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
I've always had a passion for making things look pretty, ever since I was a teenager perfecting<br>
my Myspace page and making all my friends jealous. But now, I get to channel that creative <br>
energy into coding and making things look even better!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
With 11 weeks left in the program, I'm determined to make the most of this opportunity and continue<br>
learning and growing as a coder. Check out the links below to see some of my beginner-level <br>
projects and watch as I turn my coding dreams into a reality!"</font></p></div>

<div id="box-color"><p><font size="+2">➤ Week 3 was the first assignment that made me feel like a real coder.</font><br>
         
    <font size="+2">➤ Week 5 I got to create an interactive menu in JavaScript.<br>
            Talk about a struggle, but overall I really enojyed learning how to do this!</font><br>
         
    <font size="+2">➤ Week 6 I created a War Card Game. This assignment almost cost me my<br>
        coding dreams...I was ready to give up, my code wasn't perfect but I some how got<br>
        the game to post to the console. It was a win in my book. I definitely plan to revisit <br>
        this code to try and perfect it. </font></p></div>

    <h2 id="h2">Future Goals</h2>

 <p><div id="box-color"><p><font size="+2">Upon completion of Promineo Tech's Frontend Bootcamp,<br>
     I plan to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, refreshing my skills and gaining new ones. <br>
     I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience building websites and have a strong interest in <br>
     web design. To gain more hands-on experience and increase my confidence in coding, I aim to<br>
     take several additional courses. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient web developer,<br>
     creating stunning websites and innovative apps. As I celebrate each accomplishment, I will <br> 
     proudly showcase them here for all to see. Be sure to keep checking back to witness my progress  </font></p></div>
